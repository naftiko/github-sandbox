  description: The GitHub Projects API enables developers to programmatically create and manage GitHub Projects, which are flexible tools for planning and tracking work using customizable boards, tables, and roadmaps. Through these REST API endpoints, you can create projects at the repository, organization, or user level, add and organize items like issues and pull requests, manage project fields and views, update item statuses and metadata, and automate project workflows. This API is particularly useful for integrating project management functionality into custom applications, automating project updates based on repository events, building dashboards and reporting tools, or synchronizing GitHub project data with external project management systems.

      summary: Get Project Card
      description: The Get Project Card operation retrieves detailed information about a specific card within a GitHub Project board by providing its unique card identifier. This endpoint returns comprehensive data about the card including its note content, associated issue or pull request details, creation and update timestamps, creator information, and its current position within the project column. The card_id parameter is required in the URL path to specify which card to retrieve, and the response includes metadata such as the card's URL, node ID, and archived status. This operation is useful for programmatically accessing project card details for project management automation, reporting, or integration with external tools.

      summary: Update An Existing Project Card
      description: The PATCH operation on the `/projects/columns/cards/{card_id}` endpoint allows you to modify an existing project card within a GitHub project board by providing the card's unique identifier. This API call enables you to update card properties such as the note content or archived status, giving you programmatic control over managing cards in your project workflows. You must authenticate with appropriate permissions to modify cards, and the endpoint returns the updated card object upon successful execution. This is particularly useful for automation scenarios where you need to dynamically update card information, move cards between states, or archive cards based on project progress without manually interacting with the GitHub web interface.

      summary: Move Project Card
      description: This API operation moves a project card to a different position within the same column or to a different column entirely within a GitHub project board. When making a POST request to /projects/columns/cards/{card_id}/moves, you specify the card_id of the card you want to relocate and provide parameters in the request body to define the new position, such as the target column_id and the desired position relative to other cards (top, bottom, or after a specific card). This endpoint is useful for programmatically organizing and reordering cards within project boards, enabling automation of project management workflows and integration with external tools. The operation requires appropriate authentication and permissions to modify the project board, and upon success, it returns the updated card object with its new position information.

      summary: Create Project Card
      description: Creates a new card in the specified project column identified by column_id. This endpoint allows you to add either a content card (linked to an issue or pull request) or a note card (containing plain text) to a project board column. When creating a content card, you must provide the content_id and content_type parameters to reference an existing issue or pull request. For note cards, you supply a note parameter with the desired text content. The newly created card is added to the bottom of the specified column by default, though its position can be adjusted later. This operation requires appropriate repository or organization permissions depending on whether the project is repository-level or organization-level, and the authenticated user must have write access to the project.

      summary: Move Project Column
      description: This API endpoint allows you to change the position of a project column within a GitHub project board by sending a POST request to /projects/columns/{column_id}/moves. You must specify the column_id in the URL path and provide the desired position in the request body, either as an absolute position using the "position" parameter (e.g., "first", "last", or a specific index) or relative to another column. The authenticated user must have write access to the project to perform this operation. This is useful for reorganizing project boards to better reflect workflow stages or priority order without having to recreate columns.

      description: The Update Project operation is a PATCH request to the /projects/{project_id} endpoint that allows you to modify an existing GitHub project's properties. By providing the project's unique identifier in the URL path, you can update various attributes such as the project's name, description (body), state (open or closed), organization permission levels, and privacy settings. This endpoint requires appropriate authentication and permissions to modify the project, and it returns the updated project object with all its current properties upon successful execution. The PATCH method enables partial updates, meaning you only need to include the specific fields you want to change rather than sending the entire project object.

      description: Creates a new column in a GitHub project board by sending a POST request to the /projects/{project_id}/columns endpoint, where {project_id} is the unique identifier of the target project. This operation requires authentication and appropriate permissions to modify the project. The request body must include the column name and can optionally specify the column's position within the project board. Upon successful creation, the API returns a 201 status code along with the newly created column's details, including its unique column ID, name, project URL, and creation timestamp. This endpoint is useful for programmatically organizing project workflows by adding new stages or categories to track issues and pull requests.
