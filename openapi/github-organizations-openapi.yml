You can also limit your page results using the `per_page` parameter. GitHub Enterprise Server generates a url-encoded `page` token using a cursor value for where the next page begins. For more information on cursor pagination, see "[Offset and Cursor Pagination explained](https://dev.to/jackmarchant/offset-and-cursor-pagination-explained-b89)."


        You can manage team membership with your identity provider using Enterprise Managed Users for GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

      summary: Create An Organization Webhook
      description: This API operation allows you to create a new webhook for a specified GitHub organization by sending a POST request to the /orgs/{org}/hooks endpoint, where {org} is replaced with the organization name. Webhooks enable real-time notifications when specific events occur within the organization, such as repository creation, team modifications, or membership changes. When creating the webhook, you must provide configuration details including the payload URL where GitHub will send HTTP POST payloads, the content type, optional secret for securing payloads, and specify which events should trigger the webhook. The operation requires admin privileges for the organization and returns the newly created webhook object containing its unique identifier, configuration settings, and metadata. This functionality is essential for integrating GitHub organizations with external services, CI/CD pipelines, monitoring systems, or custom automation workflows that need to respond to organizational events.

        **Note**: GitHub''s REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this

        reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by

        the `pull_request` key. Be aware that the `id` of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an _issue id_. To find out the pull

        request id, use the "[List pull requests](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/pulls/pulls#list-pull-requests)" endpoint.


        This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "[Media types](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."


        - **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include `body`. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.

        - **`application/vnd.github.text+json`**: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will include `body_text`.

        - **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns HTML rendered from the body''s markdown. Response will include `body_html`.

        - **`application/vnd.github.full+json`**: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include `body`, `body_text`, and `body_html`.'

      description: 'Adds an organization member to a team. An authenticated organization owner or team maintainer can add organization members to a team.


        Team synchronization is available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub''s products](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products) in the GitHub Help documentation.


        **Note:** When you have team synchronization set up for a team with your organization''s identity provider (IdP), you will see an error if you attempt to use the API for making changes to the team''s membership. If you have access to manage group membership in your IdP, you can manage GitHub Enterprise Server team membership through your identity provider, which automatically adds and removes team members in an organization. For more information, see "[Synchronizing teams between your identity provider and GitHub Enterprise Server](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/articles/synchronizing-teams-between-your-identity-provider-and-github/)."


        An organization owner can add someone who is not part of the team''s organization to a team. When an organization owner adds someone to a team who is not an organization member, this endpoint will send an invitation to the person via email. This newly-created membership will be in the "pending" state until the person accepts the invitation, at which point the membership will transition to the "active" state and the user will be added as a member of the team.


        If the user is already a member of the team, this endpoint will update the role of the team member''s role. To update the membership of a team member, the authenticated user must be an organization owner or a team maintainer.


        **Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using the route `PUT /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/memberships/{username}`.'
