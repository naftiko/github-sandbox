Each time you update the check run, annotations are appended to the list of annotations that already exist for the check run.

Annotations are visible in GitHub's pull request UI. The Checks API limits the number of annotations to a maximum of 50 per API request. To create more than 50 annotations, you have to make multiple requests to the [Update a check run](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/checks/runs#update-a-check-run) endpoint. Each time you update the check run, annotations are appended to the list of annotations that already exist for the check run. GitHub Actions are limited to 10 warning annotations and 10 error annotations per step.

        Lists check runs for a check suite using its `id`.

        **Signature verification object**

        The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are included in the `verification` object:

        | Name | Type | Description |
        | - | - | -- |
        | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. |
        | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in table below. |
        | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the commit. |
        | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |

        These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:

        | Value | Description |
        | -- | -- |
        | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |
        | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. |
        | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service. |
        | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. |
        | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |
        | `unknown_signature_type` | non-PGP signature was found in the commit. |
        | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. |
        | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on their account. |
        | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |
        | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. |
        | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |
        | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |
        | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |

    get:
      summary: Get Commit
      description: |-
        Returns the contents of a single commit reference. You must have `read` access for the repository to use this endpoint.

        **Note:** If there are more than 300 files in the commit diff and the default JSON media type is requested, the response will include pagination link headers for the remaining files, up to a limit of 3000 files. Each page contains the static commit information, and the only changes are to the file listing.

        This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "[Media types](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)." Pagination query parameters are not supported for these media types.

        - **`application/vnd.github.diff`**: Returns the diff of the commit. Larger diffs may time out and return a 5xx status code.
        - **`application/vnd.github.patch`**: Returns the patch of the commit. Diffs with binary data will have no `patch` property. Larger diffs may time out and return a 5xx status code.
        - **`application/vnd.github.sha`**: Returns the commit's SHA-1 hash. You can use this endpoint to check if a remote reference's SHA-1 hash is the same as your local reference's SHA-1 hash by providing the local SHA-1 reference as the ETag.

        **Signature verification object**

        The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are included in the `verification` object:

        | Name | Type | Description |
        | - | - | -- |
        | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. |
        | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in table below. |
        | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the commit. |
        | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |

        These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:

        | Value | Description |
        | -- | -- |
        | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |
        | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. |
        | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service. |
        | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. |
        | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |
        | `unknown_signature_type` | non-PGP signature was found in the commit. |
        | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. |
        | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on their account. |
        | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |
        | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. |
        | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |
        | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |
        | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |

      description: |-
        Lists check runs for a commit ref. The `ref` can be a SHA, branch name, or a tag name.

        **Note:** The endpoints to manage checks only look for pushes in the repository where the check suite or check run were created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not detected and return an empty `pull_requests` array.

        If there are more than 1000 check suites on a single git reference, this endpoint will limit check runs to the 1000 most recent check suites. To iterate over all possible check runs, use the [List check suites for a Git reference](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/reference/checks#list-check-suites-for-a-git-reference) endpoint and provide the `check_suite_id` parameter to the [List check runs in a check suite](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/reference/checks#list-check-runs-in-a-check-suite) endpoint.

        OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint on a private repository.

    get:
      summary: Compare Two Commits
      description: |-
        Compares two commits against one another. You can compare refs (branches or tags) and commit SHAs in the same repository, or you can compare refs and commit SHAs that exist in different repositories within the same repository network, including fork branches. For more information about how to view a repository's network, see "[Understanding connections between repositories](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/repositories/viewing-activity-and-data-for-your-repository/understanding-connections-between-repositories)."

        This endpoint is equivalent to running the `git log BASE..HEAD` command, but it returns commits in a different order. The `git log BASE..HEAD` command returns commits in reverse chronological order, whereas the API returns commits in chronological order.

        This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "[Media types](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."

        - **`application/vnd.github.diff`**: Returns the diff of the commit.
        - **`application/vnd.github.patch`**: Returns the patch of the commit. Diffs with binary data will have no `patch` property.

        The API response includes details about the files that were changed between the two commits. This includes the status of the change (if a file was added, removed, modified, or renamed), and details of the change itself. For example, files with a `renamed` status have a `previous_filename` field showing the previous filename of the file, and files with a `modified` status have a `patch` field showing the changes made to the file.

        When calling this endpoint without any paging parameter (`per_page` or `page`), the returned list is limited to 250 commits, and the last commit in the list is the most recent of the entire comparison.

        **Working with large comparisons**

        To process a response with a large number of commits, use a query parameter (`per_page` or `page`) to paginate the results. When using pagination:

        - The list of changed files is only shown on the first page of results, but it includes all changed files for the entire comparison.
        - The results are returned in chronological order, but the last commit in the returned list may not be the most recent one in the entire set if there are more pages of results.

        For more information on working with pagination, see "[Using pagination in the REST API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api)."

        **Signature verification object**

        The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The `verification` object includes the following fields:

        | Name | Type | Description |
        | - | - | -- |
        | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. |
        | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in table below. |
        | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the commit. |
        | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |

        These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:

        | Value | Description |
        | -- | -- |
        | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |
        | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. |
        | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service. |
        | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. |
        | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |
        | `unknown_signature_type` | non-PGP signature was found in the commit. |
        | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. |
        | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on their account. |
        | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |
        | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. |
        | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |
        | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |
        | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |

    get:
      summary: Get Repository Content
      description: |-
        Gets the contents of a file or directory in a repository. Specify the file path or directory with the `path` parameter. If you omit the `path` parameter, you will receive the contents of the repository's root directory.

        This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "[Media types](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."

        - **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw file contents for files and symlinks.
        - **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns the file contents in HTML. Markup languages are rendered to HTML using GitHub's open-source [Markup library](https://github.com/github/markup).
        - **`application/vnd.github.object+json`**: Returns the contents in a consistent object format regardless of the content type. For example, instead of an array of objects for a directory, the response will be an object with an `entries` attribute containing the array of objects.

        If the content is a directory, the response will be an array of objects, one object for each item in the directory. When listing the contents of a directory, submodules have their "type" specified as "file". Logically, the value _should_ be "submodule". This behavior exists [for backwards compatibility purposes](https://git.io/v1YCW). In the next major version of the API, the type will be returned as "submodule".

        If the content is a symlink and the symlink's target is a normal file in the repository, then the API responds with the content of the file. Otherwise, the API responds with an object describing the symlink itself.

        If the content is a submodule, the `submodule_git_url` field identifies the location of the submodule repository, and the `sha` identifies a specific commit within the submodule repository. Git uses the given URL when cloning the submodule repository, and checks out the submodule at that specific commit. If the submodule repository is not hosted on github.com, the Git URLs (`git_url` and `_links["git"]`) and the github.com URLs (`html_url` and `_links["html"]`) will have null values.

        **Notes**:

        - To Get repository's contents recursively, you can [recursively get the tree](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).
        - This API has an upper limit of 1,000 files for a directory. If you need to retrieve
        more files, use the [Git Trees API](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/git/trees#get-a-tree).
        - Download URLs expire and are meant to be used just once. To ensure the download URL does not expire, please use the contents API to obtain a fresh download URL for each download.
        - If the requested file's size is:










          - 1 MB or smaller: All features of this endpoint are supported.
          - Between 1-100 MB: Only the `raw` or `object` custom media types are supported. Both will work as normal, except that when using the `object` media type, the `content` field will be an empty
        string and the `encoding` field will be `"none"`. To get the contents of these larger files, use the `raw` media type.










          - Greater than 100 MB: This endpoint is not supported.

        Deletes a file in a repository.

        You can provide an additional `committer` parameter, which is an object containing information about the committer. Or, you can provide an `author` parameter, which is an object containing information about the author.

        The `author` section is optional and is filled in with the `committer` information if omitted. If the `committer` information is omitted, the authenticated user's information is used.

        You must provide values for both `name` and `email`, whether you choose to use `author` or `committer`. Otherwise, you'll receive a `422` status code.

        **Note:** If you use this endpoint and the "[Create or update file contents](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/repos/contents/#create-or-update-file-contents)" endpoint in parallel, the concurrent requests will conflict and you will receive errors. You must use these endpoints serially instead.

        Lists contributors to the specified repository and sorts them by the number of commits per contributor in descending order. This endpoint may return information that is a few hours old because the GitHub REST API caches contributor data to improve performance.

        GitHub identifies contributors by author email address. This endpoint groups contribution counts by GitHub user, which includes all associated email addresses. To improve performance, only the first 500 author email addresses in the repository link to GitHub users. The rest will appear as anonymous contributors without associated GitHub user information.

      summary: Create Deployment
      description: |-
        Deployments offer a few configurable parameters with certain defaults.

        The `ref` parameter can be any named branch, tag, or SHA. At GitHub Enterprise Server we often deploy branches and verify them
        before we merge a pull request.

        The `environment` parameter allows deployments to be issued to different runtime environments. Teams often have
        multiple environments for verifying their applications, such as `production`, `staging`, and `qa`. This parameter
        makes it easier to track which environments have requested deployments. The default environment is `production`.

        The `auto_merge` parameter is used to ensure that the requested ref is not behind the repository's default branch. If
        the ref _is_ behind the default branch for the repository, we will attempt to merge it for you. If the merge succeeds,
        the API will return a successful merge commit. If merge conflicts prevent the merge from succeeding, the API will
        return a failure response.

        By default, [commit statuses](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/commits/statuses) for every submitted context must be in a `success`
        state. The `required_contexts` parameter allows you to specify a subset of contexts that must be `success`, or to
        specify contexts that have not yet been submitted. You are not required to use commit statuses to deploy. If you do
        not require any contexts or create any commit statuses, the deployment will always succeed.

        The `payload` parameter is available for any extra information that a deployment system might need. It is a JSON text
        field that will be passed on when a deployment event is dispatched.

        The `task` parameter is used by the deployment system to allow different execution paths. In the web world this might
        be `deploy:migrations` to run schema changes on the system. In the compiled world this could be a flag to compile an
        application with debugging enabled.

        Merged branch response:

        You will see this response when GitHub automatically merges the base branch into the topic branch instead of creating
        a deployment. This auto-merge happens when:
        *   Auto-merge option is enabled in the repository
        *   Topic branch does not include the latest changes on the base branch, which is `master` in the response example
        *   There are no merge conflicts

        If there are no new commits in the base branch, a new request to create a deployment should give a successful
        response.

        Merge conflict response:

        This error happens when the `auto_merge` option is enabled and when the default branch (in this case `master`), can't
        be merged into the branch that's being deployed (in this case `topic-branch`), due to merge conflicts.

        Failed commit status checks:

        This error happens when the `required_contexts` parameter indicates that one or more contexts need to have a `success`
        status for the commit to be deployed, but one or more of the required contexts do not have a state of `success`.

        OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` or `repo_deployment` scope to use this endpoint.

        If the repository only has one deployment, you can delete the deployment regardless of its status. If the repository has more than one deployment, you can only delete inactive deployments. This ensures that repositories with multiple deployments will always have an active deployment.

        To set a deployment as inactive, you must:

        *   Create a new deployment that is active so that the system has a record of the current state, then delete the previously active deployment.
        *   Mark the active deployment as inactive by adding any non-successful deployment status.

        For more information, see "[Create a deployment](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/deployments/deployments/#create-a-deployment)" and "[Create a deployment status](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/deployments/statuses#create-a-deployment-status)."

      summary: Create Repository Dispatch Event
      description: |-
        You can use this endpoint to trigger a webhook event called `repository_dispatch` when you want activity that happens outside of GitHub Enterprise Server to trigger a GitHub Actions workflow or GitHub App webhook. You must configure your GitHub Actions workflow or GitHub App to run when the `repository_dispatch` event occurs. For an example `repository_dispatch` webhook payload, see "[RepositoryDispatchEvent](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/webhooks/event-payloads/#repository_dispatch)."

        The `client_payload` parameter is available for any extra information that your workflow might need. This parameter is a JSON payload that will be passed on when the webhook event is dispatched. For example, the `client_payload` can include a message that a user would like to send using a GitHub Actions workflow. Or the `client_payload` can be used as a test to debug your workflow.

        This input example shows how you can use the `client_payload` as a test to debug your workflow.

        OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint.

        **Note**: Forking a Repository happens asynchronously. You may have to wait a short period of time before you can access the git objects. If this takes longer than 5 minutes, be sure to contact [GitHub Enterprise Server Support](https://support.github.com/contact?tags=dotcom-rest-api).

        **Note**: Although this endpoint works with GitHub Apps, the GitHub App must be installed on the destination account with access to all repositories and on the source account with access to the source repository.

      summary: Create Blob
      description: The Create Blob operation in the GitHub Repos API allows you to create a new blob object in a repository's Git database by sending a POST request to /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/blobs. A blob (binary large object) represents the content of a file in Git's object database without any metadata like filename or directory structure. You must provide the file content and encoding type (typically "utf-8" or "base64") in the request body, and upon successful creation, the API returns the SHA-1 hash of the newly created blob which can then be referenced when creating trees and commits. This is a low-level Git operation typically used when programmatically building commits or when you need fine-grained control over Git objects in a repository.

        | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the commit. |
        | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |

        These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:

        | Value | Description |
        | -- | -- |
        | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |
        | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. |

        | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. |
        | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |
        | `unknown_signature_type` | non-PGP signature was found in the commit. |
        | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. |
        | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on their account. |
        | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |
        | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. |
        | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |
        | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |
        | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |

                  description: The [PGP signature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy) of the commit. GitHub adds the signature to the `gpgsig` header of the created commit. For a commit signature to be verifiable by Git or GitHub, it must be an ASCII-armored detached PGP signature over the string commit as it would be written to the object database. To pass a `signature` parameter, you need to first manually create a valid PGP signature, which can be complicated. You may find it easier to [use the command line](https://git-scm.com/book/id/v2/Git-Tools-Signing-Your-Work) to create signed commits.

        **Signature verification object**

        The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are included in the `verification` object:

        | Name | Type | Description |
        | - | - | -- |
        | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. |
        | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in the table below. |
        | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the commit. |
        | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |

        These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:

        | Value | Description |
        | -- | -- |
        | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |
        | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. |
        | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service. |
        | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. |
        | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |
        | `unknown_signature_type` | non-PGP signature was found in the commit. |
        | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. |
        | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on their account. |
        | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |
        | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. |
        | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |
        | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |
        | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |

      summary: List Matching References
      description: |-
        Returns an array of references from your Git database that match the supplied name. The `:ref` in the URL must be formatted as `heads/<branch name>` for branches and `tags/<tag name>` for tags. If the `:ref` doesn't exist in the repository, but existing refs start with `:ref`, they will be returned as an array.

        When you use this endpoint without providing a `:ref`, it will return an array of all the references from your Git database, including notes and stashes if they exist on the server. Anything in the namespace is returned, not just `heads` and `tags`.

        **Note:** You need to explicitly [request a pull request](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/pulls/pulls#get-a-pull-request) to trigger a test merge commit, which checks the mergeability of pull requests. For more information, see "[Checking mergeability of pull requests](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-git-database-api#checking-mergeability-of-pull-requests)".

        If you request matching references for a branch named `feature` but the branch `feature` doesn't exist, the response can still include other matching head refs that start with the word `feature`, such as `featureA` and `featureB`.

      summary: Create Tag Object
      description: |-
        Note that creating a tag object does not create the reference that makes a tag in Git. If you want to create an annotated tag in Git, you have to do this call to create the tag object, and then [create](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/git/refs#create-a-reference) the `refs/tags/[tag]` reference. If you want to create a lightweight tag, you only have to [create](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/git/refs#create-a-reference) the tag reference - this call would be unnecessary.

        **Signature verification object**

        The response will include a `verification` object that describes the result of verifying the commit's signature. The following fields are included in the `verification` object:

        | Name | Type | Description |
        | - | - | -- |
        | `verified` | `boolean` | Indicates whether GitHub considers the signature in this commit to be verified. |
        | `reason` | `string` | The reason for verified value. Possible values and their meanings are enumerated in table below. |
        | `signature` | `string` | The signature that was extracted from the commit. |
        | `payload` | `string` | The value that was signed. |

        These are the possible values for `reason` in the `verification` object:

        | Value | Description |
        | -- | -- |
        | `expired_key` | The key that made the signature is expired. |
        | `not_signing_key` | The "signing" flag is not among the usage flags in the GPG key that made the signature. |
        | `gpgverify_error` | There was an error communicating with the signature verification service. |
        | `gpgverify_unavailable` | The signature verification service is currently unavailable. |
        | `unsigned` | The object does not include a signature. |
        | `unknown_signature_type` | non-PGP signature was found in the commit. |
        | `no_user` | No user was associated with the `committer` email address in the commit. |
        | `unverified_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit was associated with a user, but the email address is not verified on their account. |
        | `bad_email` | The `committer` email address in the commit is not included in the identities of the PGP key that made the signature. |
        | `unknown_key` | The key that made the signature has not been registered with any user's account. |
        | `malformed_signature` | There was an error parsing the signature. |
        | `invalid` | The signature could not be cryptographically verified using the key whose key-id was found in the signature. |
        | `valid` | None of the above errors applied, so the signature is considered to be verified. |

        The tree creation API accepts nested entries. If you specify both a tree and a nested path modifying that tree, this endpoint will overwrite the contents of the tree with the new path contents, and create a new tree structure.

        If you use this endpoint to add, delete, or modify the file contents in a tree, you will need to commit the tree and then update a branch to point to the commit. For more information see "[Create a commit](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/git/commits#create-a-commit)" and "[Update a reference](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/git/refs#update-a-reference)."

        Returns an error if you try to delete a file that does not exist.

If you're creating new changes on a branch, then normally you'd set `base_tree` to the SHA1 of the Git tree object of the current latest commit on the branch you're working on.
                    If not provided, GitHub will create a new Git tree object from only the entries defined in the `tree` parameter. If you create a new commit pointing to such a tree, then all files which were a part of the parent commit's tree and were not defined in the `tree` parameter will be listed as deleted by the new commit.

Deploy keys are SSH keys that grant read-only or read-write access to a single repository, commonly used for deployment automation and CI/CD pipelines. This GET endpoint requires the repository owner and name as path parameters and returns an array of deploy key objects, each containing details such as the key ID, title, public key content, verification status, creation date, and whether the key has read-only or write access. Authentication is required, and the authenticated user must have admin access to the repository to successfully retrieve the list of deploy keys.

      summary: Merge Branch
      description: The GitHub Repos API merge branch endpoint allows you to perform a repository merge by making a POST request to /repos/{owner}/{repo}/merges. This operation merges a specified branch (the head) into another branch (the base) within the same repository. You must provide the base branch name, head branch name or SHA, and optionally a commit message in the request body. The merge will be performed automatically if there are no conflicts, and the API returns the resulting commit object upon success. If the merge cannot be completed due to conflicts or if the branches are already merged, the API will return an appropriate error response. This endpoint requires push access to the repository and is useful for programmatically managing branch merges without requiring a pull request workflow.

      description: The Update Milestone operation in the GitHub Repos API allows you to modify an existing milestone within a repository by sending a PATCH request to /repos/{owner}/{repo}/milestones/{milestone_number}. This endpoint enables you to update various milestone properties such as the title, state (open or closed), description, and due date. You must specify the repository owner, repository name, and milestone number in the URL path, while the fields you wish to update are provided in the request body as JSON. This operation requires appropriate authentication and write permissions to the repository, and it returns the updated milestone object upon successful execution, making it useful for project management tasks like adjusting deadlines, renaming milestones, or closing completed milestones.

      summary: Request Github Enterprise Server Pages Build
      description: |-
        You can request that your site be built from the latest revision on the default branch. This has the same effect as pushing a commit to your default branch, but does not require an additional commit. Manually triggering page builds can be helpful when diagnosing build warnings and failures.

        Build requests are limited to one concurrent build per repository and one concurrent build per requester. If you request a build while another is still in progress, the second request will be queued until the first completes.

      description: The Delete Release Asset operation removes a specific asset file from a GitHub repository release by targeting its unique asset ID. This DELETE endpoint requires authentication and appropriate permissions to modify releases in the specified repository. When executed, it permanently deletes the asset file (such as binaries, archives, or documentation) that was previously uploaded to a release, freeing up storage space and removing the download option for users. The operation is irreversible and returns a 204 No Content status upon successful deletion, making it useful for removing outdated, incorrect, or unnecessary release artifacts from your GitHub releases.

This endpoint requires the repository owner's username, the repository name, and the unique identifier of the release to retrieve its associated assets. Assets typically include downloadable files such as compiled binaries, source code archives, documentation, or other artifacts that are bundled with a particular release. The response includes metadata for each asset such as name, size, download count, content type, browser download URL, and creation timestamp. This operation is useful for programmatically accessing release artifacts, monitoring download statistics, or integrating release assets into automated deployment pipelines.

      summary: Upload Release Asset
      description: |-
        This endpoint makes use of a [Hypermedia relation](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#hypermedia) to determine which URL to access. The endpoint you call to upload release assets is specific to your release. Use the `upload_url` returned in
        the response of the [Create a release endpoint](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/releases/releases#create-a-release) to upload a release asset.

        You need to use an HTTP client which supports [SNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) to make calls to this endpoint.

        Most libraries will set the required `Content-Length` header automatically. Use the required `Content-Type` header to provide the media type of the asset. For a list of media types, see [Media Types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml). For example:

        `application/zip`

        GitHub Enterprise Server expects the asset data in its raw binary form, rather than JSON. You will send the raw binary content of the asset as the request body. Everything else about the endpoint is the same as the rest of the API. For example,
        you'll still need to pass your authentication to be able to upload an asset.

        When an upstream failure occurs, you will receive a `502 Bad Gateway` status. This may leave an empty asset with a state of `starter`. It can be safely deleted.

        **Notes:**
        *   GitHub Enterprise Server renames asset filenames that have special characters, non-alphanumeric characters, and leading or trailing periods. The "[List release assets](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/releases/assets#list-release-assets)"
        endpoint lists the renamed filenames. For more information and help, contact [GitHub Enterprise Server Support](https://support.github.com/contact?tags=dotcom-rest-api).
        *   To find the `release_id` query the [`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest` endpoint](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/releases/releases#get-the-latest-release).
        *   If you upload an asset with the same filename as another uploaded asset, you'll receive an error and must delete the old file before you can re-upload the new asset.

      description: The Replace All Repository Topics operation is a PUT request to the GitHub Repos API endpoint /repos/{owner}/{repo}/topics that allows you to completely replace the existing list of topics associated with a specific repository. Unlike adding or removing individual topics, this operation overwrites all current topics with the new set provided in the request body. You must provide the repository owner's username and the repository name in the URL path, along with authentication credentials that have the necessary permissions to modify repository settings. The request body should contain a JSON object with a "names" array listing all the topics you want to assign to the repository, where topics are short descriptive keywords that help categorize and improve discoverability of the repository on GitHub.

        You must use a personal access token or an OAuth token for this endpoint. An installation access token cannot be used because it is only granted access to a single account.

      summary: Create Repository Using Template
      description: |-
        Creates a new repository using a repository template. Use the `template_owner` and `template_repo` route parameters to specify the repository to use as the template. If the repository is not public, the authenticated user must own or be a member of an organization that owns the repository. To check if a repository is available to use as a template, get the repository's information using the [Get a repository](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/repos/repos#get-a-repository) endpoint and check that the `is_template` key is `true`.

        OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `public_repo` or `repo` scope to create a public repository, and `repo` scope to create a private repository.

        Find repositories via various criteria. This method returns up to 100 results [per page](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api).

        When searching for repositories, you can get text match metadata for the **name** and **description** fields when you pass the `text-match` media type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/search/search#text-match-metadata).

        For example, if you want to search for popular Tetris repositories written in assembly code, your query might look like this:

        `q=tetris+language:assembly&sort=stars&order=desc`

        This query searches for repositories with the word `tetris` in the name, the description, or the README. The results are limited to repositories where the primary language is assembly. The results are sorted by stars in descending order, so that the most popular repositories appear first in the search results.

            # Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

            ## Our Pledge

            In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

            ## Our Standards

            Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

            * Using welcoming and inclusive language
            * Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
            * Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
            * Focusing on what is best for the community
            * Showing empathy towards other community members

            Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

            * The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
            * Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
            * Public or private harassment
            * Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
            * Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

            ## Our Responsibilities

            Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response


















                              to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

            Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

            ## Scope

            This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address,


















                              posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

            ## Enforcement

            Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [EMAIL]. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

            Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

            ## Attribution

            This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org), version 1.4, available at [http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/).

If you're using GitHub Actions, a good default value for this could be the environment variables GITHUB_WORKFLOW and GITHUB_JOB concatenated together. If you're using a build matrix, then you'll also need to add additional key(s) to distinguish between each submission inside a matrix variation.
